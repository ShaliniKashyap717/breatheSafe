### Breathe Better with BreatheSafe | Combating Air Pollution With Personalized Health Insights

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Air pollution is a growing global health crisis, claiming **~7 million lives every year**. Poor air quality triggers or worsens:

- **Respiratory diseases**
- **Cardiovascular conditions**
- **Allergies and asthma**

Vulnerable groups—children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing conditions—bear the brunt.  
While raw air-quality data is widely available, most people still lack **personalized, actionable guidance** to manage their exposure and health risks.
